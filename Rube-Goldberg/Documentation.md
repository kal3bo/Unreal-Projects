## Concept
Sequence of emblematic events that build an entertaining parade that sponsors a famous club in Moscow. The club has two main stages, contemporary and youth music; Pool tables, drinks, entertainment and more.
## Sumary of sequence
The event begins when the guest presses a striking button in the center of the club, which will automatically spawn a heavy ball on the first pool table, which hits a domino sequence.

The sequence of dominos pushes a first billiard ball that will cover half of the establishment passing on the back stage.

At the end of the course of the first billiard balls, the last one will fall on the second pool table, on which there is a pile of different balls that will push a final sequence of dominos and will end up sinking in the corners of the table.

With the fall of the last domino, a wave of smoke will fill the main stage while a last ball of steel runs through the installations. At the end of the last ball journey, the smoke will dissipate and the club logo will appear on the stage.
